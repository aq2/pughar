      Sivananda Yoga is a classical and holistic approach to Hatha Yoga that stretches and tones 
      the whole body.
    p.
      This style of yoga has not been modified or watered down. The teachings have survived intact 
      and are practiced as originally presented in India by Swami Sivananda in 1936. Sivananda Yoga 
      is an international practice which follows the same format worldwide.
    p.
      Sivananda Yoga is a complete healing system designed to help the body maintain a natural 
      healthy state. It was developed by Vishnu-Devananda who wrote one of the contemporary Yoga 
      classics, <i>The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga</i>, first published in 1960 and still one 
      of the best introductions to yoga available. Sivananda training involves frequent relaxation 
      and emphasizes full, yogic breathing.
