        This style of yoga has not been modified or watered down. The teachings have survived intact
        and are practiced as originally presented in India by Swami Sivananda in 1936. Sivananda Yoga
        is an international practice which follows the same format worldwide.
      p.
        Sivananda Yoga is a complete healing system designed to help the body maintain a natural
        healthy state. It was developed by Vishnu-Devananda who wrote one of the contemporary Yoga
        classics, <i>The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga</i>, first published in 1960 and still one
        of the best introductions to yoga available.
